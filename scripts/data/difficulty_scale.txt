DOOM WAD DIFFICULTY SCALE (1-10)

Rate difficulty as a decimal (e.g., 3.7, 6.2). NEVER use integers.

1 - "Kindergarten Trip to Hell"
    Baby's first demons. You could win with a trackpad. Meant for total
    beginners or relaxation. Easier than Doom 1 Episode 1 on ITYTD.

2 - "Sunday Stroll Through Gore"
    Minimal challenge. You might die if you go AFK. Good for chilling
    or showing the game to your grandma. Think Doom 1 on HMP.

3 - "The Way id Did It"  [BASELINE]
    Original Doom 1 & Doom 2 on Ultra-Violence. The sacred baseline.
    Challenging but fair. You'll die sometimes. This is the anchor.
    Benchmarks: Doom II UV, Memento Mori, Doom the Way id Did.

4 - "Romero's Revenge"
    Tougher than vanilla. Tighter ammo, meaner traps. You'll restart
    some maps. Good mappers making you work for it.
    Benchmarks: TNT Evilution, SIGIL, Jenesis.

5 - "Plutonia's Playground"
    The Casali brothers send their regards. Archviles in closets,
    chaingunners on ledges, and you're always low on shells.
    Benchmarks: Plutonia Experiment, Valiant, Going Down.

6 - "Welcome to the Slaughterhouse"
    Hordes appear. You need to learn crowd control. Maps start
    requiring strategy, not just reflexes. Adventure meets carnage.
    Benchmarks: Alien Vendetta, Ancient Aliens, Eviternity late maps.

7 - "Hell Revealed Your Weakness"
    Brutal. Long maps, high monster counts, unforgiving design.
    You will memorize these maps. Patience is mandatory.
    Benchmarks: Hell Revealed, Scythe maps 26-30, Speed of Doom.

8 - "Ribbiks Sends His Regards"
    Peak slaughter. Every inch of space matters. Combat puzzles
    where there's one way to survive and you must find it.
    Benchmarks: Sunlust, Stardate 20X6, Sunder early maps.

9 - "Dante's Reject Pile"
    For the 1%. Hours of practice for a single map. You are dodging
    walls of revenant missiles while juggling cyberdemons.
    Benchmarks: Sunder late maps, Dimensions, Italo Doom.

10 - "Only Decino Wins"
    Theoretical human limits. Often considered impossible until
    someone proves otherwise. May require TAS or divine intervention.
    Benchmarks: Okuplok, Nuts.wad, the maps speedrunners cry about.
